# csvTranslator
Project created for my blog post on using Ruby and Go to translate a csv file. See Dev.to.

# Create Json Translation Dictionary
To run this beautiful code, make sure you've put a correctly formatted .csv file in the `dictionary` directory, navigate to the root of the project in the terminal and run `ruby dictionary/translate_key.rb` and you should see a new json file pop up in the `dictionary` directory.
